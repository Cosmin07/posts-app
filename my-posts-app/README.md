This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

-In this app I used the followings:
- [https://ant.design] for UI components,
- [https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction] for state management
- [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/] for get data

The app it is deployed to Vercel can be accesed here: https://posts-app-a358.vercel.app/en

The app can be improved by adding unit test, imporove renderging parts and so one, by from time contranints I present as it is for you.

Apprecat your time to review it.
